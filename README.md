### About the project
This project is Prediction of Flight Cancellation. The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle's Flight Status Prediction dataset.
The models used in this project are Decision Tree Classifier, Bagging Classifier and Adaboost Classifier.
The primary challenge faced in this project is the class imbalance problem due to the skewed distribution of the Target attribute.
We tried three approaches to overcome this problem by doing oversampling using SMOTE and ADASYN and undersampling using RandoUnderSampler.
Oversampling using ADASYN and SMOTE showed the best results when used with Bagging Classifier.
